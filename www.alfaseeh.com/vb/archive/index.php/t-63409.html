 <br />
Background:<br />
Phoenician traders settled the area early in the 1st Millennium BC; several centuries later the Romans invaded, And by AD 40 they had control of the Mediterranean Coast. The fall of Rome in the 5th century led to invasion by the Vandals and later by Byzantium. The Islamic conquest began in the 7th century; by 711 All of northern Africa was under the control of the Umayyad caliphate. Several Islamic Berber empires followed, most prominently the Almoravid (c.<br />
1054ñ1130), which extended its domain to Spain, and the Almohad (c. 1130 1269). The Barbary Coast pirates, operating in the area, had menaced Mediterranean trade for centuries, and France seized this pretext to enter Algeria in 1830. By 1847 France had established control in the region, and by the late 19th century it had instituted civil rule. Popular movements resulted in the bloody Algerian War (1954ñ62); independence was achieved following a<br />
referendum in 1962.<br />

 <br />
The area has long been an important trading center and is mentioned in Persian, Greek, and Roman references. It was ruled by Arabs from the 7th century AD but was then occupied by the Portuguese in 1521ñ1602. Since 1783 it has been ruled by the Khalifah family, though through a series of treaties its defense remained a British responsibility from 1820 to 1971. After Britain withdrew its forces from the Persian Gulf (1968), Bahrain declared its independence<br />
in 1971. It served as a center for the allies in the Persian Gulf War (1990ñ91).Constitutional revisions, ratified in 2002, made Bahrain a constitutional<br />
monarchy.<br />

<br />
Background<br />
 <br />
Egypt is home to one of the worldís oldest continuous<br />
civilizations. Upper and Lower Egypt were united c.<br />
3000 BC, beginning a period of cultural achievement<br />
and a line of native rulers that lasted nearly 3,000<br />
years. Egyptís ancient history is divided into the Old,<br />
Middle, and New Kingdoms, spanning 31 dynasties<br />
and lasting to 332 BC. The pyramids date from the Old<br />
Kingdom, the cult of Osiris and the refinement of<br />
sculpture from the Middle Kingdom, and the era of<br />
empire and the Exodus of the Jews from the New<br />
Kingdom. An Assyrian invasion occurred in the 7th<br />
century BC, and the Persian Achaemenids established<br />
a dynasty in 525 BC. The invasion by Alexander the<br />
Great in 332 BC inaugurated the Macedonian Ptolemaic<br />
period and the ascendancy of Alexandria. The<br />
Romans held Egypt from 30 BC to AD 395; later it was<br />
placed under the control of Constantinople. Constantineís<br />
granting of tolerance in 313 to the Christians<br />
began the development of a formal Egyptian (Coptic)<br />
church. Egypt came under Arab control in 642 and ultimately<br />
was transformed into an Arabic-speaking<br />
state, with Islam as the dominant religion. Held by the<br />
Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, in 969 it became<br />
the center of the Fatimid dynasty. In 1250 the Mamluks<br />
established a dynasty that lasted until 1517,<br />
when Egypt fell to the Ottoman Turks. An economic<br />
decline ensued, and with it a decline in Egyptian culture.<br />
Egypt became a British protectorate in 1914<br />
and received nominal independence in 1922, when a<br />
constitutional monarchy was established. A coup<br />
overthrew the monarchy in 1952, with Gamal Abdel<br />
Nasser taking power. Following three wars with Israel,<br />
Egypt, under Nasserís successor,<br />

Background<br />
 <br />
Called Mesopotamia in Classical times, the region<br />
gave rise to the worldís earliest civilizations, including<br />
those of Sumer, Akkad, and Babylon. invaded by<br />
Alexander the Great in 330 BC, the area later became<br />
a battleground between Romans and Parthians and<br />
then between Sasanians and Byzantines. Arab Muslims<br />
conquered it in the 7th century AD and ruled until<br />
the Mongols took over in 1258. The Ottomans took<br />
control in the 16th century and ruled until 1917. The<br />
British occupied the country during World War I and<br />
created the kingdom of Iraq in 1921. The British occupied<br />
Iraq again during World War II. A king was restored<br />
following the war, but a revolution ended the<br />
monarchy in 1958. Following a series of military<br />
coups. The Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s and the Persian<br />
Gulf War (precipitated by the Iraqi invasion of<br />
Kuwait in 1990) brought heavy casualties and disrupted<br />
the economy. The 1990s were dominated by<br />
economic and political turmoil. In response to<br />
the contention that Iraq was in possession of<br />
weapons of mass destruction (none were ever<br />
found), on 19 Mar 2003 air attacks on Baghdad<br />
began, and soon afterward US and British ground<br />
forces invaded southern Iraq from Kuwait; within a<br />
month most of the country was under the control of<br />
coalition forces. Saddam was taken into custody in<br />
December. In July 2003 US authorities established<br />
an Iraqi Governing Council, and a new interim constitution<br />
was agreed upon in late February 2004. Almost<br />
immediately after the occupation began, however,<br />
various forms of Iraqi opposition arose, and<br />
resistance attacks grew in frequency and violence in<br />
the years that followed.<br />

Background<br />
Jordan shares much of its history with Palestine, since<br />
both occupy the area known historically as Palestine.<br />
Much of present-day eastern Jordan was<br />
under Kings David and Solomon c.<br />
1000 BC. It fell to the Seleucids in 330 BC and to Muslim<br />
Arabs in the 7th century AD. The Crusaders extended<br />
the kingdom of Jerusalem east of the Jordan<br />
River in 1099. Jordan submitted to Ottoman Turkish<br />
rule during the 16th century. In 1920 the area comprising<br />
Jordan (then known as the Transjordan) was<br />
established within the British mandate of Palestine.<br />
Transjordan became an independent state in 1927,<br />
although the British mandate did not end until 1948.<br />
After hostilities with the new state of Israel ceased in<br />
1949, Jordan annexed the West Bank of the Jordan<br />
River, administering the territory until Israel gained<br />
control of it in the Six-Day War of 1967. In 1970ñ71<br />

Background<br />
Faylakah Island, in Kuwait Bay, had a civilization<br />
dating back to the 3rd millennium BC that flourished until 1200 BC. Greek colonists resettled the island in<br />
the 4th century BC. Abd Rahim of the Sabah dynasty<br />
became sheikh in 1756, the first of a family that<br />
continues to rule Kuwait. In 1899, to thwart German<br />
and Ottoman influences, Kuwait gave Britain control<br />
of its foreign affairs. Following the outbreak of war<br />
in 1914, Britain established a protectorate there. In<br />
1961, after Kuwait became independent, Iraq laid<br />
claim to it. British troops defended Kuwait, the Arab<br />
League recognized its independence, and Iraq<br />
dropped its claim. Iraqi forces invaded and occupied<br />
Kuwait in 1990, and a US-led military coalition<br />
drove them out in 1991. The destruction of many of<br />
Kuwaitís oil wells complicated reconstruction efforts.<br />

century the Ottoman Turks combined Libyaís three regions<br />
under one regency in Tripoli. In 1911 Italy<br />
claimed control of Libya, and by the outbreak of World<br />
War II, 150,000 Italians lived there. It became an independent<br />
state in 1951. The discovery of oil in<br />
1959 brought wealth to Libya. A decade later a group<br />
of army officers led by Muammar al-Qaddafi deposed<br />
the king and made the country an Islamic republic.<br />

Background<br />
Inhabited in ancient times by Sanhadja Berbers, in<br />
the 11th and 12th centuries Mauritania was the center<br />
of the Berber Almoravid movement, which imposed<br />
Islam. Arab tribes arrived in the 15th century<br />
and formed powerful confederations; the Portuguese<br />
also arrived then. France gained control of the coast<br />
in 1817 and in 1903 made the territory a protectorate.<br />
In 1904 it was added to French West Africa,<br />
and later it became a colony. In 1960 Mauritania<br />
achieved independence. Its first president was<br />
ousted in a 1978 military coup. After a series of military<br />
rulers, in 1991 a new constitution was adopted,<br />
and multiparty elections were held in 1992. The<br />
country faced continued economic hardship and political<br />
unrest, including coups, in the late 20th and<br />
early 21st centuries.<br />

Background<br />
The Berbers entered Morocco near the end of the<br />
2nd millennium BC. Phoenicians established trading<br />
posts along the Mediterranean during the 12th century<br />
BC, and Carthage had settlements along the Atlantic<br />
in the 5th century BC. After the fall of Carthage,<br />
Morocco became a loyal ally of Rome, and in AD 42 it<br />
was annexed by Rome as part of the province of Mauretania.<br />
It was conquered by Muslims in the 7th century.<br />
Beginning in the mid-11th century, the Almoravids,<br />
Almohads, and Marinids ruled successively. After the<br />
fall of the Marinids in the mid-15th century, the<br />
SaAdis ruled for a century beginning in 1550. The<br />
French fought Morocco over the Algerian boundary in<br />
the 1840s, and the Spanish seized part of Moroccan<br />
territory in 1859. It was a French protectorate from<br />
1912 until its independence in 1956. In the mid-<br />
1970s it reasserted claim to the Western Sahara,<br />
and in 1976 Spanish troops withdrew from the region,<br />
leaving behind the Algerian-supported Saharan<br />
guerrillas of the Polisario movement. Relations with<br />
Mauritania and Algeria deteriorated, and fighting<br />
over the region continued. Attempts at mediation<br />
have repeatedly been made by the international community.<br />

Background<br />
Oman has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years.<br />
Arabs began migrating there in the 9th century BC.<br />
Tribal warfare was endemic until the conversion to<br />
Islam in the 7th century AD. It was ruled by Ibadi<br />
imams until 1154, when a royal dynasty was established.<br />
The Portuguese controlled the coastal areas<br />
from about 1507 to 1650, when they were expelled.<br />
The Al Bu SaAid dynasty, founded in the mid-18th century,<br />
still rules Oman. Oil was discovered in 1964. In<br />
1970 the sultan was deposed by his son, who began<br />
a policy of modernization, and under him the country<br />
joined the Arab League and the UN. In the Persian<br />
Gulf War, Oman cooperated with the allied forces<br />
against Iraq. In the 1990s it continued to expand its<br />
foreign relations.<br />

Background<br />
Saudi Arabia is the historical home of Islam, founded<br />
by Muhammad in Medina in 622. During medieval<br />
times, local and foreign rulers fought for control of the<br />
Arabian Peninsula; in 1517 the Ottomans prevailed.<br />
In the 18thñ19th centuries Islamic leaders supporting<br />
religious reform struggled to regain Saudi territory,<br />
all of which was restored by 1904. The British<br />
held Saudi lands as a protectorate from 1915 to<br />
1927; then they acknowledged the sovereignty of the<br />
Kingdom of the Hejaz and Najd. The two kingdoms<br />
were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.<br />
Since World War II, it has supported the Palestinian<br />
cause in the Middle East and maintained close ties<br />
with the US.<br />

<br />
Background<br />
From the end of the 4th millennium BC, Nubia (now<br />
the northern Sudan) periodically came under Egyptian<br />
rule, and it was part of the kingdom of Cush<br />
from the 11th century BC to the 4th century AD. Christian<br />
missionaries converted the Sudanís three principal<br />
kingdoms during the 6th century AD; these<br />
black Christian kingdoms coexisted with their Muslim<br />
Arab neighbors in Egypt for centuries, until the<br />
influx of Arab immigrants brought about their collapse<br />
in the 13thñ15th centuries. Egypt had conquered<br />
all of the Sudan by 1874 and encouraged<br />
British interference in the region; this aroused Muslim<br />
opposition and led to the revolt of al-Mahdi, who<br />
captured Khartoum in 1885 and established a Muslim<br />
theocracy in the Sudan that lasted until 1898,<br />
when Mahdist forces were defeated by the British.<br />
The British ruled the country, generally in partnership<br />
with Egypt, until The Sudan achieved independence<br />
in 1956. Since then the country has fluctuated<br />
between ineffective parliamentary government<br />
and unstable military rule. The non-Muslim population<br />
of the south began rebellion against the Muslim-<br />
controlled government of the north in the early<br />
1980s, leading to famines and the displacement of<br />
millions of people. Meanwhile, fighting broke out in<br />
2003 between non-Arab Muslims in the Darfur region<br />
of western Sudan and government-backed Arab<br />
militias known as Janjaweed; tens of thousands of<br />
people were killed and hundreds of thousands more<br />
were displaced.<br />

Background<br />
Syria has been inhabited for several thousand years.<br />
From the 3rd millennium BC it was under the control<br />
variously of Sumerians, Akkadians, Amorites, Egyptians,<br />
Hittites, Assyrians, and Babylonians. In the 6th<br />
century BC it became part of the Persian Achaemenian<br />
dynasty, which fell to Alexander the Great in 330<br />
BC. Seleucid rulers governed it from 301 BC to c. 164<br />
BC; Parthians and Nabataean Arabs then divided the<br />
region. It flourished as a Roman province (64 BCñAD<br />
300) and as part of the Byzantine Empire<br />
(300ñ634) until Muslims invaded and established<br />
control. It came under the Ottoman Empire in 1516,<br />
which held it, except for brief rules by Egypt, until<br />
the British invaded in World War I. After the war it<br />
became a French mandate; it achieved independence<br />
in 1945. It united with Egypt in the United<br />
Arab Republic (1958ñ61). During the Six-Day War<br />
(1967), it lost the Golan Heights to Israel. Syrian<br />
troops frequently clashed with Israeli troops in<br />

most of present-day Tunisia. The Romans<br />
ruled from 146 BC until the Muslim Arab conquest in<br />
the mid-7th century AD. The area was fought over,<br />
won, and lost by many, including the Abbasids, the Almohads,<br />
the Spanish, and the Ottoman Turks, who finally<br />
conquered it in 1574 and held it until the late<br />
19th century. For a time it maintained autonomy as<br />
the French, the British, and the Italians contended for<br />
the region. In 1881 Tunisia became a French protectorate.<br />
In World War II, US and British forces captured<br />
it (1943) to end a brief German occupation. In 1956<br />
France granted it full independence; Habib Bourguiba<br />
assumed power and remained in office until<br />
1987.<br />

Background<br />
The Persian Gulf was the location of important trading<br />
centers as early as Sumerian times. Its people<br />
converted to Islam in Muhammadís lifetime. The<br />
Portuguese entered the region in the early 16th<br />
 <br />
century, and the British East India Company arrived<br />
about 100 years later. In 1820 the British exacted<br />
a peace treaty with local rulers along the coast of<br />
the eastern Arabian Peninsula. The area formerly<br />
called the Pirate Coast became known as the Trucial<br />
Coast. In 1892 the rulers agreed to restrict foreign<br />
relations to Britain. Though the British administered<br />
the region from 1853, they never assumed<br />
sovereignty; each state maintained full internal control.<br />
The states formed the Trucial States Council in<br />
1960. In 1971 the sheikhs terminated defense<br />
treaties with Britain and established the six-member<br />
federation. Ras al-Khaymah joined it in 1972.<br />

Background<br />
Yemen was the home of ancient Minaean,<br />
Sabaean, and Himyarite kingdoms. The Romans invaded<br />
the region in the 1st century AD. In the 6th<br />
century it was invaded by Ethiopians and Persians.<br />
Following conversion to Islam in the 7th century,<br />
it was ruled nominally under a caliphate. The<br />
Egyptian Ayyubid dynasty ruled there from 1173 to<br />
1229, after which the region passed to the Rasulids.<br />
From 1517 through 1918, the Ottoman Empire<br />
maintained varying degrees of control, especially<br />
in the northwestern section. A boundary<br />
agreement was reached in 1934 between the<br />
northwestern imam-controlled territory, which subsequently<br />
became the Yemen Arab Republic (North<br />
Yemen), and the southeastern British-controlled territory,<br />
which subsequently became the Peopleís Democratic<br />
Republic of Yemen (South Yemen). Relations<br />
between the two Yemens remained tense and<br />
were marked by conflict throughout the 1970s and<br />
1980s. Reaching an accord, the two officially united<br />
as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. Its 1993 elections<br />
were the first free, multiparty general elections<br />
held in the Arabian Peninsula, and they were<br />
the first in which women participated. In 1994,<br />
after a two-month civil war, a new constitution was<br />
approved.<br />

 <br />
Background<br />
The Comoro Islands were known to European navigators<br />
from the 16th century. In 1843 France officially<br />
took possession of Mayotte and in 1886 placed the<br />
other three islands under protection. Subordinated to<br />
Madagascar in 1912, Comoros became an overseas<br />
territory of France in 1947. In 1961 it was granted<br />
autonomy. In 1974 majorities on three of the islands<br />
voted for independence, which was granted in 1975.<br />
The following decade saw several coup attempts,<br />
which culminated in the assassination of the president<br />
in 1989. French intervention permitted multiparty<br />
elections in 1990, but the country remained in<br />
a state of chronic instability. Anjouan and MohÈli seceded<br />
from the Comoros federation in 1997. The<br />
army took control of the government in 1999. A referendum<br />
at the end of 2001 renamed the country<br />
the Union of the Comoros and granted the three main<br />
islands partially autonomous status.<br />

Background<br />
Settled around the 3rd century BC by the Arab ancestors<br />
of the Afars, Djibouti was later populated by Somali<br />
Issas. In AD 825 Islam was brought to the area by<br />
missionaries. Arabs controlled the trade in this region<br />
until the 16th century; it became the French protectorate<br />
of French Somaliland in 1888. In 1946 it became<br />
a French overseas territory, and in 1977 it<br />
gained its independence. In the late 20th century, the<br />
country received refugees from the Ethiopian-Somali<br />
war and from civil conflicts in Eritrea. In the 1990s it<br />
suffered from political unrest.<br />

Background<br />
Muslim Arabs and Persians first established trading<br />
posts along the coasts of Somalia in the 7thñ10th<br />
centuries. By the 10th century Somali nomads occupied<br />
the area inland from the Gulf of Aden, and<br />
the south and west were inhabited by various groups<br />
of pastoral Oromo peoples. Intensive European exploration<br />
began after the British occupation of Aden<br />
in 1839, and in the late 19th century Britain and<br />
Italy set up protectorates in the region. During World<br />
War II the Italians invaded British Somaliland<br />
(1940); a year later British troops retook the area,<br />
and Britain administered the region until 1950,<br />
when Italian Somaliland became a UN trust territory.<br />
In 1960 it was united with the former British Somaliland,<br />
and the two became the independent Republic<br />
of Somalia. Since then it has suffered political<br />
and civil strife, including military dictatorship, civil<br />
war, drought, and famine. No effective central government<br />
has existed since the early 1990s. In 1991<br />
a proclamation of a Republic of Somaliland, on territory<br />
corresponding to the former British Somaliland,<br />
was issued by a breakaway group, but it did not receive<br />
international recognition. A multinational force<br />
intervened from 1992 to 1994 in an unsuccessful<br />
attempt to stabilize the region. The country remained<br />
in turmoil.<br />
